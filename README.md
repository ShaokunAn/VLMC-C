# VLMC-C
VLMC-C algorithm is a new context tree inference algorithm for variable length Markov chains model.
When embedding the full order MC in a sparse structured context tree, it is founded on the consistent branch-specific mixed chi-square distribution 
calculated based on asymptotic normal distribution.
